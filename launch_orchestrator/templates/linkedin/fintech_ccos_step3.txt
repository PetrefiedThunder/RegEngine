Hi {FIRST_NAME}, I'm working with RegEngine, which turns unstructured regulations into machine-readable obligations and gap analyses.

We're helping compliance leaders reduce manual regulatory review by 30–50% by:
- Ingesting and normalizing regulatory documents
- Extracting obligations/thresholds/jurisdictions
- Highlighting gaps vs internal policies

I'd like to share a 2-page overview and see if this is relevant for your team. Open to a quick look?
