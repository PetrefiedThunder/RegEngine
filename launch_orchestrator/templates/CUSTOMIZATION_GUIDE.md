# Email & LinkedIn Template Customization Guide

## AI-Generated Content Notice

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All email and LinkedIn templates in this directory were AI-generated based on best practices for B2B SaaS sales. Before using:

1. **Review for voice/tone alignment** with your brand
2. **Customize placeholders** (company name, URLs, contact info)
3. **Test with small audience** before bulk deployment
4. **Track performance** and iterate based on response rates

## Template Variables

All templates support the following variables (replace before sending):

### Standard Variables
- `{FIRST_NAME}` - Prospect's first name
- `{COMPANY_NAME}` - Prospect's company
- `{JURISDICTIONS}` - Comma-separated list of jurisdictions they operate in
- `{SENDER_NAME}` - Your name
- `{SENDER_TITLE}` - Your title (e.g., "CEO", "Head of Partnerships")
- `{SENDER_EMAIL}` - Your email address
- `{CALENDLY_LINK}` - Your scheduling link (Calendly, Cal.com, etc.)

### Usage Example

**Before**:
```
Hi {FIRST_NAME},

I'm reaching out because teams like yours at {COMPANY_NAME} are tracking regulations across {JURISDICTIONS}...
```

**After**:
```
Hi Sarah,

I'm reaching out because teams like yours at Acme Fintech are tracking regulations across US, EU, UK, and Singapore...
```

## Customization Checklist

  - [ ] Verify `{CALENDLY_LINK}` is working
  - [ ] Test email in spam checker
  - [ ] Verify all links are HTTPS

- [ ] **Step 2 Email**:
  - [ ] Ensure consistency with Step 1 voice
  - [ ] Update any changed product features
  - [ ] Verify sandbox link is live

- [ ] **Step 3 LinkedIn**:
  - [ ] Shorten if over 300 characters

## A/B Testing Suggestions

Test these variations to optimize performance:

### Subject Lines
- **Version A** (Current): "Automate regulatory change tracking across {JURISDICTIONS}..."
- **Version B** (Shorter): "Reduce compliance work by 60%"
- **Version C** (Question): "Still tracking regulations manually?"
- **Version D** (Social Proof): "How [Company X] automated regulatory monitoring"

### CTAs
- **Version A** (Current): "Would you be open to a 20-minute conversation..."
- **Version B** (Direct): "Book a 15-minute demo: [link]"
- **Version C** (Low Commitment): "Want to see a 2-minute video demo?"
- **Version D** (Curiosity): "I'll send over a case study—interested?"

### Personalization Depth
- **Low**: Name only
- **Medium**: Name + company + jurisdiction
- **High**: Name + company + jurisdiction + recent funding/news

**Recommendation**: Start with Medium personalization, measure reply rates, then test High for top prospects.

## Compliance Considerations

### CAN-SPAM / GDPR Compliance

Ensure all emails include:
- [ ] Physical mailing address in footer
- [ ] Unsubscribe link (one-click)
- [ ] Company name
- [ ] Clear identification as marketing email

### LinkedIn Terms of Service

- [ ] Do NOT use automation tools that violate LinkedIn ToS
- [ ] Send connection requests manually or via Sales Navigator
- [ ] Limit to 100 connection requests per week
- [ ] Personalize every message (no bulk templates)

## Integration with CRM

Map template stages to CRM pipeline:

| Template | CRM Stage | Next Action |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Step 1 Email | Outreach | Wait 2 days, send Step 2 |
| Step 2 Email | Engaged | Wait 3 days, try LinkedIn |
| Step 3 LinkedIn | Engaged | Wait for response or mark cold |
| Demo Booked | Qualified | Prepare demo environment |

## Response Handling

### Positive Responses

**If they reply "Yes, interested"**:
1. Respond within 2 hours
2. Offer 2-3 specific time slots
3. Send calendar invite with Zoom link
4. Include pre-demo questionnaire (optional)

**If they reply "Send me more info"**:
1. Send one-pager (generated by orchestrator)
2. Include 2-minute demo video link
3. Offer to schedule call after review

### Objections

**"We're already using [Competitor]"**:
→ "Great! Many of our customers use [Competitor] for policy management and use RegEngine for the upstream regulatory intelligence layer. Would you be open to seeing how they integrate?"

**"Not right now / too busy"**:
→ "Totally understand. Would it make sense to reconnect in [Q2/Q3]? I can send a brief update when we launch [new feature]."

**"Too expensive"**:
→ "Let's walk through the ROI: If your team spends 40 hours/week on manual regulatory tracking, that's $120k/year in labor cost. RegEngine costs $6k/year for the Professional tier. You're ROI-positive in Month 1."

**"We're building this internally"**:
→ "Interesting! How far along are you? We've found that teams typically spend 18 months and $1M+ to get to production. Happy to share what we've learned if helpful."

## Iteration Schedule

Review and update templates:
- **Weekly**: Response rates, open rates, bounce rates
- **Monthly**: Subject line A/B test results
