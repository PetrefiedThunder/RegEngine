Subject: Re: Making your regulatory obligations machine-readable

Hi {FIRST_NAME},

Following up on my earlier note—our customers keep telling us the same three things:

1. They're drowning in multi-jurisdiction regulatory updates.  
2. They struggle to keep a clean mapping from regulation → obligation → control.  
3. They have no single source of truth for **why** a particular control exists.

RegEngine was built to fix exactly that.

We:
- Normalize incoming regulations (PDF, HTML, etc)
- Extract obligations, thresholds, and effective dates
- Persist everything in a graph model with full provenance

The result is:
- A queryable regulatory obligation layer
- Traceability for audit and board reporting
- The ability to see where your controls are over- or under-scoped

If this resonates at all, even as a *directional* interest, I'd be happy to walk through:
- A quick demo using our sample data
- A path to testing this on a subset of your regulations in a sandbox

Worth a brief conversation?

Best,  
{SENDER_NAME}
