Subject: Automate regulatory change tracking across {JURISDICTIONS} in days, not months

Hi {FIRST_NAME},

I'm reaching out because teams like yours are being asked to do the impossible:
- Track continuous regulatory change across {JURISDICTIONS}
- Map every new obligation to internal controls
- Demonstrate an auditable trail from regulation → policy → control

**RegEngine** is a regulatory intelligence engine that does three things extremely well:

1. **Ingests and normalizes regulations** from multiple jurisdictions  
2. **Extracts obligations, thresholds, and jurisdictions** into machine-readable structures  
3. **Highlights gaps and inconsistencies** in your current control framework

Most compliance teams we speak with spend **30–50% of their time** on manual regulatory review and interpretation. With RegEngine, that time can be redirected to *actual risk decisions* rather than document wrangling.

Would you be open to a **20-minute conversation** next week to see:
- How we map regulations to obligations and controls
- How our opportunity/gap API plugs into your existing systems
- What "machine-readable regulation" looks like on your own examples

If you're interested, feel free to grab a time here: {CALENDLY_LINK}  
—or just reply with a yes and I'll suggest a few slots.

Best,
