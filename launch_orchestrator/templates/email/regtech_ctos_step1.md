Subject: Embed regulatory intelligence in your product without building the infrastructure

Hi {FIRST_NAME},

I noticed {COMPANY_NAME} is in the RegTech/compliance space, and I wanted to reach out about something that might save your team 12-18 months of engineering work.

Most RegTech platforms face the same infrastructure challenge:
- **Regulatory data ingestion** (handling PDFs, OCR, normalization)
- **NLP extraction** (obligations, thresholds, jurisdictions)
- **Multi-jurisdiction coverage** (keeping up with SEC, FCA, ESMA, MAS, etc.)
- **Provenance tracking** (audit trail from regulation → obligation)

This is exactly what **RegEngine** provides as an OEM-licensable API layer.

Instead of building this yourself, you can:
1. **Embed our API** as your regulatory data backbone
2. **Focus on your differentiated UX** and workflow features
3. **Launch new jurisdictions** in days, not months
4. **Offer better coverage** than competitors who build in-house

We're working with RegTech vendors who:
- White-label our API under their brand
- Pay via revenue share or flat licensing fee
- Co-develop jurisdiction prioritization

**Would you be open to a quick call** to discuss:
- How our graph-based regulatory engine works
- What OEM licensing looks like (pricing, SLAs, white-labeling)
- A technical deep dive on API integration

If this resonates, grab time here: {CALENDLY_LINK}
—or just reply and I'll send some slots.

Best,
