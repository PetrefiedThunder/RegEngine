Subject: Re: Regulatory data infrastructure for RegTech platforms

Hi {FIRST_NAME},

Following up on my note about RegEngine's OEM licensing for RegTech platforms.

I wanted to share a quick case study from how we're working with similar companies:

**The Problem They Faced**:
- Spent 18 months building regulatory ingestion + NLP in-house
- Burned through $1M+ in engineering budget
- Coverage was limited to 3-5 jurisdictions
- Every new jurisdiction took 3-6 months to add
- NLP accuracy was inconsistent (60-70% precision)

**What They Get with RegEngine**:
- Immediate access to 20+ jurisdictions (roadmap: 50+)
- NLP extraction with 90%+ precision (and improving with ML)
- Graph-based relationship mapping across regulations
- Provenance tracking for audit compliance
- **Focus shifted from data infrastructure to customer-facing features**

**OEM Model**:
- White-label our API under your brand
- Pricing: Revenue share or flat annual license
- Technical integration: REST API, typically 2-4 weeks
- Support: Dedicated Slack channel, priority bug fixes
- Roadmap input: Your customers influence jurisdiction priorities

The teams that succeed with this approach are those who:
1. Want to focus on workflow and user experience (not data plumbing)
2. Need to expand jurisdiction coverage quickly
3. Prefer OpEx (licensing) over CapEx (engineering team)

Worth a conversation? I can walk through:
- Our API architecture and data model
- Integration examples from current OEM partners
- Pricing scenarios based on your volume

Let me know!

Best,
{SENDER_NAME}
