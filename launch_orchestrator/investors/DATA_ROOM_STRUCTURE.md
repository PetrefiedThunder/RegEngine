## Document Preparation Checklist

### Must-Have Documents (Required for all investors)

- [x] Investor memo (PDF, 10-20 pages)
- [x] Pitch deck (PDF, 15 slides)
- [ ] Financial model (Excel, with assumptions)
- [ ] Cap table (Excel, certified by counsel)
- [ ] Certificate of Incorporation
- [ ] IP assignment agreements (founders)
- [ ] Product demo video (5 minutes)
- [ ] Product roadmap (PDF, 18 months)

- [ ] Security architecture diagram
- [ ] API documentation sample
- [ ] Market sizing analysis (detailed)
- [ ] Competitive SWOT analysis
- [ ] Hiring plan (12 months)
- [ ] Use of funds breakdown (detailed)

### Stage-Specific Documents

**Pre-seed / Seed**:

- Less critical: Detailed financials, legal docs (beyond basics)

**Series A**:
- Focus on: Traction, unit economics, go-to-market validation
- Critical: Detailed financials, customer pipeline, retention metrics

---

## Document Formatting Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Consistent branding**: Use RegEngine logo, colors, fonts
2. **Professional formatting**: No typos, clean layout, readable fonts
3. **Confidentiality markings**: "Confidential - For Investor Review Only" on each page
4. **Version control**: Include date and version number (e.g., "v1.2 - Jan 2025")
5. **Contact info**: Include contact email/phone on cover pages

### File Naming Convention

```
RegEngine_[Category]_[DocumentName]_[Date].pdf

Examples:
- RegEngine_Product_TechnicalArchitecture_2025-01.pdf
- RegEngine_Financial_Model_2025-01.xlsx
- RegEngine_Legal_CertificateOfIncorporation_2025-01.pdf
```

### Redactions

**What to redact**:
- Customer names (unless permission granted)
- Pricing details in contracts (use anonymized ranges)
- Personal information (SSNs, addresses)
- Trade secrets (specific algorithms, proprietary data)

**What NOT to redact**:
- Financials (investors need full transparency)
- Legal structure (investors need to understand ownership)
- Product capabilities (need to sell the vision)

## Tracking & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track (if using DocSend)

1. **Document views**:
   - Which documents are most viewed?
   - Which pages are read vs. skipped?
   - Average time spent per document

2. **Investor engagement**:
   - Who viewed which documents?
   - When did they view (shows urgency/interest)?
   - Did they forward to partners?

3. **Conversion funnel**:
   - Pitch deck → Full memo (shows serious interest)
   - Memo → Financial model (shows diligence phase)
   - Financial model → Legal docs (shows term sheet preparation)

### Red Flags to Watch

- Investor views pitch deck but never opens memo → Low interest
- Investor opens financial model but doesn't request reference calls → Concern about numbers
- Investor forwards documents to many people → Could be shopping your deal

---

## Update Schedule

**Weekly** (during active fundraise):
- KPI dashboard (traction metrics)
- Sales pipeline
- Product usage analytics

**Monthly**:
- Financial model (update actuals)
- Cap table (if new option grants)
- Product roadmap (if priorities shift)

**As needed**:
- Legal documents (as new contracts signed)
- Team bios (as new hires join)
- Competitive landscape (as new competitors emerge)

---

## Security Best Practices

### Document Protection

1. **Watermarking**: Add investor name + date to PDFs
2. **No download**: Use view-only access (if platform supports)
3. **Expiration**: Set 90-day access, renewable on request
4. **Revocation**: Be able to revoke access if deal falls through

### Sensitive Information Handling

1. **Customer names**: Use "Fortune 500 Bank" instead of "JPMorgan Chase"
2. **Pricing**: Use ranges ("$50k-$100k ACV") instead of exact numbers
3. **Secret sauce**: Describe capabilities, not implementation details
4. **Employee names**: Only share C-level, redact individual contributors

### Compliance

1. **Regulation D**: Only share with accredited investors
2. **NDA**: Consider requiring signed NDA before data room access
3. **MNPI**: Be careful not to share material non-public information (if you have investors/advisors from public companies)
