## Outreach Channels

### 1. Warm Introductions (Highest priority)

**Success rate**: 40-60% response rate
**Process**:
1. Identify mutual connections via LinkedIn, Twitter, email signature searches
2. Ask for double opt-in intro: "Would you be willing to introduce me to [Investor] at [Firm]?"
3. Provide forwardable blurb (see template below)

**Forwardable Blurb Template**:

```
Hi [Mutual Connection],

Hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out because we're raising a $1.5M seed round for RegEngine, and I noticed you know [Investor Name] at [VC Firm].

**Quick context**: RegEngine is a regulatory intelligence API that transforms PDFs into machine-readable obligations. We help fintech companies automate compliance monitoring across jurisdictions (think: Plaid for regulatory data).

We're in early conversations with [Other VC Name] and [Other VC Name], and [Investor Name]'s thesis around [specific thesis - e.g., "embedded compliance"] seems like a perfect fit.

Would you be willing to make an intro if you think it's a good fit? Happy to share our deck/memo if helpful.

No worries if not—appreciate you either way!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### 2. Cold Email (Medium priority)

**Success rate**: 5-15% response rate
**Best practices**:
- Personalize first 2 sentences (reference their portfolio, tweet, blog post)
- Keep under 100 words
- Clear CTA (30-min call)
- Send Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-11am local time

**Template**: See "Cold Email - Initial Outreach" below

### 3. Twitter/LinkedIn DM (Lower priority)

**Success rate**: 2-5% response rate
**When to use**: Investor is very active on social media, recently posted about relevant topic
**Best practice**: Reference specific recent post, keep under 280 characters

## Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Email - Initial Outreach

```
Subject: Regulatory intelligence API ($1.5M seed)

Hi [Investor First Name],

I saw [Firm Name]'s investment in [Portfolio Company] and your thesis around [specific area - e.g., "embedded fintech infrastructure"].

**We're building the regulatory intelligence API** that powers compliance automation. RegEngine transforms unstructured regulations (PDFs) into machine-readable obligations via NLP + graph database.

**Traction**:
- 5 design partners (mid-market fintech companies)
- $2M ARR projected by end of Year 1
- OEM licensing model (think: Plaid for regulatory data)

**The raise**: $1.5M seed, closing in 4 weeks

**Would you have 30 minutes** next week for a quick call? Happy to send our deck/memo if helpful.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Title], RegEngine
[Email] | [Phone]
```

**Personalization tips**:
- Line 1: Reference specific portfolio company or thesis area
- Adjust traction bullets based on latest metrics
- Adjust closing timeline based on actual fundraising progress

### Template 2: Follow-Up (No Response after 5 days)

```
Subject: Re: Regulatory intelligence API ($1.5M seed)

Hi [Investor First Name],

Following up on my note from last week about RegEngine (regulatory intelligence API for fintech compliance).

**Quick addition**: We just closed our first design partner (Fortune 500 bank) who's integrating our API for multi-jurisdiction capital requirements tracking.

**The opportunity**: $22B GRC market, but no API-first player for regulatory data infrastructure.

**Still raising**: $1.5M seed, $800k committed, closing in 3 weeks.

15-minute call to discuss? I'll send our deck if there's interest.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: Deck Send (After Interest)

```
Subject: RegEngine deck + investor memo

Hi [Investor First Name],

Great chatting earlier! As promised, here's our deck and investor memo:

**Deck** (15 slides): [Google Drive / DocSend Link]
**Investor Memo** (detailed): [Google Drive / DocSend Link]

**Quick recap of what we discussed**:
- Problem: Compliance teams spend 40 hours/week manually tracking regulatory changes
- Solution: NLP-powered API that extracts obligations from regulations
- Business model: SaaS ($499-$2,500/mo) + OEM licensing for RegTech vendors
- Ask: $1.5M seed to reach $2M ARR by end of Year 1

**Next steps**: Let me know your initial thoughts after reviewing. Happy to do a deeper dive or connect you with one of our design partners for reference.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 4: Post-Deck Follow-Up (After 3 days)

```
Subject: Re: RegEngine deck + investor memo

Hi [Investor First Name],

Wanted to follow up on the deck I sent last week. A few updates since we last spoke:

- **New design partner**: [Company Name] just signed (8-week eval program)
- **Product milestone**: Launched multi-jurisdiction arbitrage API (detects regulatory differences across US/UK/EU)
- **Fundraise timeline**: $1.2M committed, $300k remaining, planning to close in 2 weeks

**Would you like to schedule a follow-up call** to discuss next steps? I can also arrange a reference call with one of our design partners if that's helpful.

Let me know!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 5: Partner Meeting Request (After Positive Feedback)

```
Subject: RegEngine - Partner meeting?

Hi [Investor First Name],

Thanks for the positive feedback on the deck! Glad the regulatory intelligence thesis resonates.

**Next step**: Would it make sense to present to the broader partnership? I can prepare a 20-minute presentation + Q&A.

**Topics we can cover**:
- Product demo (live API walkthrough)
- Market sizing & competitive landscape
- Design partner feedback & validation
- Financial projections & unit economics
- Use of funds & 18-month roadmap

**Availability**: I'm flexible next week. Let me know what works for your team.

Also happy to provide any additional materials beforehand (financial model, customer testimonials, technical architecture, etc.).

Looking forward to it!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 6: Reference Call Coordination

```

**Context for [Investor]**:
- [Company Name] is a [industry] company with [size/description]

### Template 7: Soft No (Pass after review)

```
Subject: Re: RegEngine - Thank you

Hi [Investor First Name],

Thanks for taking the time to review RegEngine. I appreciate the thoughtful feedback.

**Totally understand** that [reason for pass - e.g., "it's earlier than your typical investment stage" / "outside your core thesis area"] makes it not the right fit right now.

**Would you be open to staying in touch?** I'll send quarterly updates as we hit milestones, and would love to revisit the conversation if the timing becomes better.

Also - if there are other investors in your network who focus on [e.g., "API-first infrastructure" / "RegTech"], I'd be grateful for any intros.

Thanks again for your time!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If there's anything specific we could do to make this a better fit in the future (e.g., "come back at $X ARR" / "prove out X use case"), I'd love to hear it.
```

### Template 8: Hard No (Not interested)

```
Subject: Re: RegEngine - Thank you

Hi [Investor First Name],

Thanks for the quick response. Appreciate you saving us both time by being upfront.

If anything changes or if we can be helpful in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best of luck with your portfolio!

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 9: Term Sheet Received (Update to other investors)

```
Subject: RegEngine fundraise update - Term sheet received

Hi [Investor First Name],

Quick update on the RegEngine raise:

We've received a term sheet from [VC Firm Name] to lead our $1.5M seed round. We're currently in final diligence and expect to close within 2-3 weeks.

**We have $300k remaining** in the round for additional investors. Given your earlier interest, wanted to see if you'd like to participate.

**Next steps if interested**:
- Term sheet review (can share redacted version)
- Reference calls with design partners
- Final diligence materials (financial model, legal docs)
- **Decision needed by [Date - typically 1 week]**

Let me know if you'd like to discuss!

## Common Objections & Responses

### Objection 1: "It's too early for us"

**Response**:
"Totally understand. We're targeting $1.5M seed, but would you be open to revisiting once we hit [milestone - e.g., $500k ARR / 10 paying customers]? I'd love to stay in touch and send quarterly updates."

### Objection 2: "Market is too small / niche"

**Response**:
"Great question. The GRC market is $22B, and regulatory intelligence is a $2.2B subset. Our wedge is fintech (50k+ companies globally), but we're also seeing demand from healthcare, crypto, and insurance. Long-term, any industry with regulatory complexity is a potential customer."

### Objection 3: "What if regulators provide APIs themselves?"

**Response**:
"We'd welcome that! But realistically, regulatory bodies move slowly. The SEC has been promising structured data for 10+ years. Even if they do, our value is cross-jurisdictional normalization—no single regulator provides global coverage. We're also building relationships with regulators to be their API layer."

### Objection 4: "Why wouldn't customers build this in-house?"

**Response**:
"Some try—but they realize it's not core to their business. Our design partners spent 18+ months building in-house NLP and only covered 3-5 jurisdictions. With RegEngine, they get 20+ jurisdictions out of the box and can focus on their differentiated UX. Classic 'build vs. buy' equation, and we're betting on buy."

### Objection 5: "What's your moat?"

**Response**:
"Three things: (1) Data network effects—every document we ingest improves our NLP model. (2) Regulatory relationships—we're building partnerships with SEC, FCA, etc. for early access. (3) Graph database—our knowledge graph of cross-jurisdictional relationships is hard to replicate."
