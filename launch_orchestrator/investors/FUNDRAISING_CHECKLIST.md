## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Fundraising Process

1. ❌ **Starting too late**: Begin fundraising 3-6 months before you *need* the money (not when you're running out)
2. ❌ **Too few investors**: Need to talk to 50-100 investors to close 1-3. Don't stop at 10.
3. ❌ **Long gaps between meetings**: Momentum is critical. Schedule meetings densely (multiple per week).
4. ❌ **No urgency**: Create urgency with closing deadlines. Don't let fundraise drag on 6+ months.
5. ❌ **Taking first term sheet**: Always get 2-3 term sheets to negotiate best terms.

### Pitch Mistakes

1. ❌ **Too much product, not enough market**: Investors invest in *markets*, not features. Spend 50% of pitch on market/problem.
2. ❌ **Weak financials**: Have a bottoms-up financial model. Don't just say "we'll get 1% of a $10B market."
3. ❌ **Dismissing competition**: Never say "we have no competitors." Show you understand competitive landscape.
4. ❌ **No customer proof**: Need customer testimonials, usage data, or signed LOIs. Investors don't bet on PowerPoints.

### Term Sheet Mistakes

1. ❌ **Optimizing only for valuation**: Terms matter as much as valuation. A $10M valuation with bad terms < $8M with good terms.
2. ❌ **Taking money from wrong investor**: Investor fit matters. Check references (talk to their portfolio companies).
3. ❌ **Not reading fine print**: Super pro-rata, participating preferred, full-ratchet anti-dilution are red flags.
