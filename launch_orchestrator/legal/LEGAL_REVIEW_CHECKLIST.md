## Red Flags to Discuss with Attorney

Immediately flag these issues if they apply:

🚩 **Partner wants to use in production** → This violates "evaluation only" restriction
🚩 **Partner requests IP ownership of outputs** → Major IP issue
🚩 **Partner asks to remove liability cap** → Insurance/risk management issue
🚩 **Partner operates in sanctioned country** → Export control/OFAC issue
🚩 **Partner requests we indemnify them** → Insurance/risk issue
🚩 **Partner is government entity** → Special procurement rules may apply
