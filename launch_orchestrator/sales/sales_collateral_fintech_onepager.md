# RegEngine – Fintech Compliance One-Pager

## Who We Help

Fintechs and digital banks operating across multiple jurisdictions (e.g., US, EU, UK) who need to:

- Track regulatory changes continuously
- Map obligations to internal controls
- Maintain auditable, end-to-end lineage

---

## What RegEngine Does

RegEngine turns unstructured regulations into **machine-readable obligations** and **gap insights**, so your compliance team can:

1. **Know what changed** – across jurisdictions and over time
2. **Understand obligations** – in a normalized, queryable format
3. **See the gaps** – between regulatory obligations and your internal controls

---

## How It Works (Overview)

1. **Ingest & Normalize**
   - Pulls regulatory documents from trusted sources.
   - Normalizes content (PDF, HTML, scanned docs).
   - Deduplicates using content hashes.
   - Stores artifacts with deterministic paths and provenance.

2. **Extract Obligations**
   - NLP models identify obligations, thresholds, entities, and jurisdictions.
   - Units are normalized (e.g., currencies, time periods).
   - Effective dates and versioning are tracked.

3. **Persist in a Graph**
   - Model obligations, regulations, entities, and controls as nodes and relationships.
   - Query for "which control exists because of this article" or "which obligations changed in QX?"

4. **Surface Gaps & Opportunities**
   - Compare obligations across jurisdictions.
   - Detect missing or misaligned controls.
   - Produce reports for internal committees and the board.

## Key Benefits for Fintechs

- **Reduce manual review time by 30–50%**
- **Shorten policy update cycles** after regulatory changes
- **Improve audit readiness** with end-to-end lineage
- **Lower compliance risk** by systematically identifying gaps

---

## Example Use Cases

- New EU regulation affecting your US product:
  - What changed?
  - Which obligations apply to your current operations?
  - Are your controls aligned or missing?

- Board audit committee asks:
  - "Show us how our controls map to obligations across the US, UK, and EU."
  - RegEngine can surface this mapping directly from the graph.

---

## Integration & Deployment

- **API-first** – easy to integrate with existing systems.
- **AWS-native deployment** – can run in your environment or as a managed service.
- **Design partner program** – start in a sandbox to de-risk adoption.

---

## Getting Started

1. Start with 1–2 jurisdictions.
2. Ingest your priority regulations.
3. Map existing controls to extracted obligations.
4. Run gap analysis and review results with your compliance team.
