        """Fetch FDA guidance documents by topic"""
        # Implementation: Use FDA API or scrape website
        pass

    def extract_obligations(self, document_text):
        """Extract SHOULD/MUST/SHALL obligations from FDA guidance"""
        # FDA uses specific language: "should", "must", "shall"
        # NLP extracts these as obligations
        pass
```

### Energy Example: NERC Standards

```python
# services/ingestion/industry_plugins/energy/nerc_standards.py
