# RegEngine: Product Positioning & Messaging

## Positioning Statement

**For** compliance teams and risk officers at financial institutions, RegTech vendors, and legal tech platforms **who need** to monitor global regulatory changes and automate compliance obligations,

**RegEngine** is a Regulatory Intelligence API Platform **that** ingests, normalizes, and graphs regulatory documents from multiple jurisdictions, automatically extracting obligations, thresholds, and requirements.

**Unlike** manual compliance tracking, legacy GRC tools, or expensive legal research platforms,

**RegEngine** provides machine-readable regulation with queryable provenance, cross-jurisdictional arbitrage detection, and policy gap analysis—all accessible via API.

---

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. **Automate Regulatory Monitoring**
**Problem**: Compliance teams spend 40+ hours/week manually tracking regulatory updates across multiple jurisdictions.

**Solution**: RegEngine automatically ingests regulations from global sources, detects changes, and alerts you to new obligations.

**Value**: Reduce compliance monitoring headcount by 60%. Ensure zero missed regulatory updates.

---

### 2. **Machine-Readable Regulation**
**Problem**: Regulations are published as PDFs and HTML—unusable for automated systems.

**Solution**: RegEngine converts any regulatory document into structured, queryable data with extracted obligations, thresholds, and metadata.

**Value**: Build compliance automation on top of standardized regulatory data. Integrate directly into your risk management systems.

---

### 3. **Cross-Jurisdictional Intelligence**
**Problem**: Global firms waste resources complying with duplicative requirements or miss arbitrage opportunities.

**Solution**: RegEngine's graph database maps relationships across jurisdictions, identifying threshold differences, gaps, and overlaps.

**Value**: Optimize licensing strategy. Identify competitive advantages. Avoid over-compliance.

---

### 4. **Audit-Ready Lineage**
**Problem**: Auditors and regulators demand proof that policies map to specific regulatory requirements.

**Solution**: Every extracted obligation includes provenance: source URL, document offset, page number, and SHA-256 hash.

**Value**: Pass audits faster. Demonstrate compliance with traceable evidence. Reduce audit prep by 50%.

## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"RegEngine is an API platform that turns regulatory PDFs into machine-readable data. We automatically extract obligations, thresholds, and requirements from global regulations, map them in a graph database, and provide APIs for compliance automation, gap analysis, and regulatory arbitrage detection."

### Two-Sentence Pitch (Email/LinkedIn)
"RegEngine converts regulatory documents into machine-readable data with queryable obligation extraction and cross-jurisdictional analysis. We provide the regulatory intelligence layer that powers automated compliance."

### Problem-Agitate-Solve (Sales Call Opener)
**Problem**: "You're tracking regulations across 12 jurisdictions manually, using spreadsheets and PDFs, right?"

**Agitate**: "And when a regulation changes, you have 30 days to update internal policies, train staff, and notify the board—while also monitoring 50 other regulatory bodies."

**Solve**: "RegEngine automates this. We ingest regulations from any source, extract every obligation automatically, and alert you to changes within 24 hours. Plus, our graph database shows you exactly how your requirements differ across jurisdictions."

## Objection Handling

### "We already use [Competitor]"
**Response**: "Great! Many of our customers use [Competitor] for policy management and use RegEngine for the upstream regulatory intelligence layer. We provide the machine-readable regulation; they handle the downstream workflow. Would you like to see how they integrate?"

### "We can build this internally"
**Response**: "Absolutely, and some of our customers did exactly that. They discovered it took 18 months and 3 engineers just to get basic ingestion working—before tackling NLP, graph databases, and multi-jurisdiction normalization. We've already solved those problems. How quickly do you need this capability?"

### "Regulatory data is free/public"
**Response**: "True—the PDFs are free. But making them machine-readable, extractable, queryable, and provenance-tracked? That's the engineering challenge. You're not paying for the data; you're paying for the infrastructure that makes it usable."

### "This seems expensive"
**Response**: "Let's do the math: If your team spends 40 hours/week on manual regulatory tracking, that's $120k/year in labor cost alone. RegEngine costs [pricing], automating 60% of that work. You're ROI-positive in [X] months."

### "How do we know the extractions are accurate?"
**Response**: "Great question. Every extraction includes provenance—the exact document offset, page number, and source URL. You can verify any obligation in seconds. Plus, we're currently at [X]% precision on obligation extraction, and we continuously improve with customer feedback."
